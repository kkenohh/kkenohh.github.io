#### Post-Game Takes on Jets vs Chiefs
Some of the worst officiating I've ever seen at the end of that game. Multiple missed holding calls on Chiefs' offensive line, along with an extremely late holding call on Sauce. Disgusting.

Despite the loss, the Jets played great and I think there's lots of hope for the future. The defense started out completely lost, giving up 17 points in the first quarter, but quickly went back to themselves, only giving up 2 field goals the rest of the game. Just like the rest of the season, Quincy Williams and CJ Mosley were making plays all over the field, dropping back into coverage, tackles for losses, and even getting an interception on Mahomes.
